			"description": "For my Bachelors Thesis, performed an in-depth study of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and exploits. Also did a comprehensive study of various mechanisms to safeguard systems against buffer overflow attacks. Using ‘ptrace’, designed a utility that monitors the target process and in case of a buffer overflow, reports the instruction which caused the attack and kills the process before any exploits can occur."
